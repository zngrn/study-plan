### Open Action Items:

  - Pick a language of choice for interviews:
    - python
    - ruby
    - golang
    - clojure
    - typescript

  - Order of preference:
    python > golang > ruby > clojure > typescript

  - Rationale:
    - python -> longest use of language. still comfortable. not happy about newer version of python, environment handling etc.
    - golang -> interesting language. minimal footprint. might need to learn some more but writing it extensively, but for problem solving seems neat.
    - ruby -> simple, neat language. may need to look up points/in-build methods and neater tricks from time to time.
    - clojure -> functional in nature. haven't written it frequently and lack of depth may divert attention from real intent.
    - typescript -> javascript ecosystem. say. no. more.
